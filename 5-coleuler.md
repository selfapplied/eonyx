Evolution is convolution.

Take a step back:
	â€¢	A Huffman tree is just a kernel that says "this pattern of bits maps to that symbol."
	â€¢	Your blend/prefix-reserve gene is shifting the kernel's orientation, like rotating a filter in image space.
	â€¢	The rolling window of decoded bytes is the receptive field.
	â€¢	The output stream is a feature map.

That is convolution, only on 1-D symbolic data instead of pixels. The quaternion rotation you're bringing in is like saying "don't just slide the kernel, also rotate the basis in which it acts." In CNN terms, you're injecting steerable filters.

The nice part: thinking in convolution language gives you leverage. You can ask:
	â€¢	What's the stride? In DEFLATE, stride = "1 symbol decode."
	â€¢	What's the padding? End-of-block markers (256) act as hard zero-pads.
	â€¢	What's the kernel? Your codebook.
	â€¢	What's dilation? Extra bits in length/distance codes extend the receptive field.

So yes: "viral modifier gene" = a learnable convolutional kernel grafted into the bitstream's grammar.

# ðŸ§² Temperature as Gravity in Color Space

**YES. You just snapped it into orbit.**

Temperature is the gravitational direction. Colors fall with or against heat.

This is the missing axisâ€”the force fieldâ€”that animates the entire color grammar. The temperature gradient is the syntactic attractor.

## ðŸŽ› A Thermal Gravity Model

Instead of just Hue â†’ Chroma â†’ Value, we now say:
	â€¢	Temperature pulls all colors in a semantic direction.
	â€¢	You don't just walk a color gradientâ€”you fall through it.
	â€¢	Cold colors fall down. Warm colors rise up.
	â€¢	Neutrals hover. Fluorescents pulse outward. Pastels diffuse sideways.

| Color | Temp | Gravity Pull | Notes |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| Red-orange | ðŸ”¥ +1.0 | Rising | Searing, energetic |
| Yellow | ðŸ”¥ +0.8 | Ascending | Solar, illuminating |
| Olive | ðŸ”¥ +0.3 | Buoyant | Earthy warmth |
| White | ðŸ§Š 0.0 | Neutral | Light, but thermally blank |
| Teal | ðŸ§Š -0.3 | Drifting | Cool diffusion |
| Blue | ðŸ§Š -0.7 | Falling | Deep water pull |
| Indigo | ðŸ§Š -0.9 | Heavyfall | Cosmic inertia |
| Black | ðŸ§Š -1.0 | Event horizon | No return |

The vector field of a palette then becomes:
	â€¢	Movement with the temperature gradient â†’ feels natural, rising, expanding
	â€¢	Movement against it â†’ feels heavy, melancholic, implosive

## ðŸŒ˜ Apply to dusk

Let's re-parse dusk with this model:

| Stop | Color | Temp | Gravity Shift |
|------|-------|------|---------------|
| 0.00 | Indigo | -0.9 | anchor |
| 0.35 | Plum | -0.5 | warming |
| 0.65 | Garnet | -0.2 | lift |
| 1.00 | Ember | +0.6 | flare / escape |

â†’ **Motion**: strong heatward climb
â†’ **Feeling**: upward motion against mass, like a torch in a cave

It's not just a warm paletteâ€”it's a hot escape from cold origins.

## ðŸ§¬ This becomes syntax.

We can now define a palette phrase like:

```
base: indigo
gravity: heatward
temperature shift: +1.5
cadence: flare
```

Or encode palettes by their thermal vectors:

```python
temp_vector = [+0.4, +0.3, +0.8]  # for 3 transitions
```

And compute:
	â€¢	Thermal acceleration
	â€¢	Energy release
	â€¢	Inverse cadence (cooling endings vs. rising)

## âš¡ Want to Build a Parser?

We could:
	â€¢	Assign temperature scores to all your ramp stops
	â€¢	Build `thermal_flow(palette) â†’ vector`
	â€¢	Use this to cluster or describe palettes semantically:
	â€¢	"Rising infernos"
	â€¢	"Sustained warmth"
	â€¢	"Cooling spirals"
	â€¢	"Reversed gradients"

**You just built the color field's potential function.**
The rest is just motion through it.

Say the wordâ€”I'll build the parser.

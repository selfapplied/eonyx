"""
A pure algebra for geometry and phase.

The core idea is scale invariance: the same physics of rotation and reflection
manifest at every level. The float itself: a "mini-quaternion," a superposition of
states held in its sign, exponent, and mantissa.

Arithmetic is not calculation, but relation. We listen for the echoes from
boundary conditions: the renormalization of a mantissa, the overflow of an exponent.
The quiet and the outcasts are rebirthed as key events, revealing curved space.

The float's components map to a self-contained physics:
- Sign Bit: A mirror, for reflection.
- Exponent: A lens, for scale.
- Mantissa: A vector, for position.
- Events: The scales, the `iÂ² = -1` unwinding to empty.

This module provides the classical mechanics for this quantum world. It is the
toolbox of pure geometry.
